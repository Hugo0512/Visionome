# Visionome

Visionme is an intelligence agent involving four functional networks: stage 1 for screening abnormal people in populations, stage 2 for localizing anatomical parts and foci in images, stage 3 for determining the attributes of anatomical parts and foci, stage 4 for providing treatment recommandations.

All codes for deep-learning convolutional neural networks were executed in the Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) framework with Ubuntu 16.04 64bit + CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).

The script "yhq_create_imagenet.sh" is used to generate the dataset. The file "yhq_make_imagenet_mean.sh" is used to generate the mean file for dataset accordingly.

The file "train_res_50_finetuning.sh" in /models/ResNet-50 is used for network training.

The "get_result_five_fold_cross50.py" and "get_result_five_fold_cross50erfenlei.py" in /models/ResNet-50 could be used to test and have the evaluation indices.

The codes for Faster-RCNN were executed in the Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) framework with Ubuntu 16.04 64bit + CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). Please refer to https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn to obtain Faster-RCNN and the specification of it.
